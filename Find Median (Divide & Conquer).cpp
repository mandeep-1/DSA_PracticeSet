Take some test cases and verify your algorithm.
Take care of base conditions.
To solve it in logarithmic time complexity use modified binary search.
Binary search can be used to find mid elements of both arrays.
Once you get both arrays, think of various conditions.
Both arrays don't need to be the same size.
